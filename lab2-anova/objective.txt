Anova. I attempted to develop this lab with a huge dataset on radiation levels in pacific fish after Fukushima, but the data is very dirty and may not be suitable for students. It would take a lot of work to clean it. Fish names are in Japanese and so on. I was thinking instead it would be nice to find a dataset on pollution - radiation, plastic waste, etc. Basically any data which is interesting and involves a comparison of three or more means.
