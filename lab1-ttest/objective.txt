T-testing. This one I have not made. I need to find good datasets. If you recall previously we used a dataset on horned lizards to see if dead lizards had shorter horns. Unfortunately this won't work for github because the data is not public domain. The major problem in relation to this lab is therefore to find a good dataset for a t-test related problem. Biogeography would be a nice theme for this one... tree diameters, bird populations, etc.
